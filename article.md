# Introduction
### This article has two things:

1. A focused list of "premium culture" sources that I believe are high-quality and worth your time
2. A recommended way of redirecting your attention towards better content online

### This is in response to: 

1. Access to content has never been better.
2. World-class books, articles, film, music is all literally a click away.
3. However, as access to content has improved, most content is literal garbage.
4. "Free" online content is usually click-bait, or worse.
5. Other content types (e.g. social) are designed to extract attention, time, and money from you as a content consumer (as this is how these platforms make money).

### This is a simple setup that I believe is a better way of consuming the good content.

I'll be updating this guide every 6 months or so; if you'd like to be updated when this guide changes, please leave your email address here:

## The sources

### Written journals

These are periodic sourced of articles. For written journals, you want

1. Hiqhest quality content possible
2. A balance of views from the left and right
3. Content in a wide range of interesting subject areas and topics

#### [New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/)
This was the journal I started with. My grandfather was an ardent NYRB fan and I picked this source up from him. Some of these articles will show up in reputable online blogs (e.g. yCombinator, metafilter) every now and then.

For me, really good content I've found here is the work by [Rachel Cusk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Cusk), among others.

#### [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/)
This is another journal that is (obviously) focused more on the London / UK side of things. I've been reading the LRB for about ~6 months at this point and I find that they have really good narrative perspectives and reviews.

#### [New Criterion](https://newcriterion.com/)
This is a thoughtful conservative journal that is helpful to balance out point-of-views. The NYRB and the LRB are both left-of-center (although not extremely progressive). The New Criterion is helpful as a counterbalance (although you may need to be willing to deal with some out-there perspectives in the age of Trump).

#### A current events newspaper
As the above journals are only published every month, you need a source for current events that is published more regularly. Without this source, you'll feel out-of-date and go back to checking your standard set of blogs every 30 minutes.

I have found that The Wall Street Journal is my preferred source for current events. This is because the NYTimes has pivoted to be very progressive, and I find that the NYRB and LRB do a more effective job at delivering those perspectives. The WSJ covers "just the facts" in a better way and also evens out your political views. 

### Streaming video

#### The Criterion Collection
This is a great collection of just really, really good movies. After scrolling through these films it takes me a few minutes to get excited about what I want to watch, but I have pretty much never been dissapointed.

For example, some good movies that I have watched that really effected me include:
- [Wanda (1970)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_(film))
- [Salesman (1969)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesman_(1969_film))
- [8 hours don't make a day (1972-1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Hours_Don%27t_Make_a_Day)

### Streaming music

#### Apple Music

The pattern here is typically music is written about in journals above - for example, downloading the [Glenn Gould's Goldberg Variations](https://music.apple.com/us/album/bach-goldberg-variations-bwv-988-the-1955-1981-recordings/594521223) while reading [this article](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v14/n06/nicholas-spice/how-to-play-the-piano).

This source is good because it:

1. Has a massive collection
2. Is instantly available

So you can immediately get to a music source and listen next to the commentary supporting it. I've also heard Brian Wilson / Beach Boys, Don Cherry, Circuit des Yeux, and other artists I would have no occasion to try out without this source.

### Visual art
This is TBD -- I have not found a great source for this. But please stay posted as I am actively trying out alternatives

### Performance art
While some performance art (e.g. Opera with the Met Opera) has good online streaming options, I have not found anything that was moving enough to merit a standalone subscription. Please stay posted as I am actively trying out alternatives
